# SoC-Design

This project is about the design of System on Chip which would generate interrupts to send messages through UART to a COM port and display it on a terminal periodically.

The sysem was designed using custom design using a smartfusion SoC FPGA with a ARM cortex M3 hard-core. 

Skills applied: C language, VHDL ,computer architecture
IDE and tools:  Eclipse , Modelsim, Libero SoC
